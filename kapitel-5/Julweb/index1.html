        <p> Santa Claus (also known as Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick, Father Christmas, Kris Kringle, or Santa) is a
            legendary figure[1] originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts during the late
            evening and overnight hours on Christmas Eve. He is said to accomplish this with the aid of Christmas elves,
            who make the toys in his workshop, and with the aid of flying reindeer who pull his sleigh through the air.
        </p>

        <p> The popular conception of Santa Claus originates from folklore traditions surrounding the 4th-century
            Christian bishop Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of children. Saint Nicholas became renowned for his
            reported generosity and secret gift-giving. The image of Santa Claus shares similarities with the English
            figure of Father Christmas, and they are both now popularly regarded as the same person.[4]
