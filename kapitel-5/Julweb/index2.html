            In English-speaking cultures, a Christmas elf is a diminutive elf that lives with Santa Claus at the North
            Pole and acts as his helper. Christmas elves are usually depicted as green- or red-clad, with large, pointy
            ears and wearing pointy hats. They are most often depicted as humanoids, but sometimes as furry mammals with
            tails. Santa's elves are often said to make the toys in Santa's workshop and take care of his reindeer,
            among other tasks.</p>

        <p> They were first introduced in literature by Louisa May Alcott in 1856. Santa is much older, emerging in U.S.
            folklore in the early 17th century from St. Nicholas with attributes of various European Christmas
            traditions, especially from English Father Christmas and Dutch Sinterklaas. The association of Christmas
            presents with elves has precedents in the first half of the 19th century with the Scandinavian nisse or
            tomte, and St Nicholas himself is called an elf in A Visit from St. Nicholas (1823).
