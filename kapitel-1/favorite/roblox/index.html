    <h1>Roblox</h1>
    <img src="./Roblox_app_screenshot.png" alt="Roblox">
    <p>Roblox (/ˈroʊblɒks/ ROH-bloks) is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation that allows users to program and play games created by themselves or other users. Created by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. Early in Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and as a company. Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>Roblox is free to play, with in-game purchases available through a virtual currency called Robux. As of August 2020, Roblox had over 164 million monthly active users, including more than half of all American children under 16.[12][13] Although Roblox has received generally positive reviews from critics, it has faced criticism for its moderation, microtransactions, and allegations of exploitative practices toward children.</p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Roblox Studio</h3>
    <p>Roblox allows players to create their own games using its proprietary engine, Roblox Studio, which can then be played by other users.[14] Games, officially referred to as "experiences" on the platform,[15][16] are made with a derivative of the language Lua named Luau.[17] Users are able to create purchasable content through one-time purchases, known as "game passes", as well as microtransactions which can be purchased more than once, known as "developer products" or "products".[18][19] The majority of games produced using Roblox Studio are developed by minors, and a total of 20 million games a year are produced using it.[20][12]</p>
    <h3>Items and currency</h3>
    <p>Roblox allows players to buy, sell, and create virtual items which can be used to decorate their virtual character that serves as their avatar on the platform.[12] Previously, only Roblox administrators had the ability to sell accessories, body parts, gear, and packages under the official Roblox user account,[21] with virtual hats and accessories also being able to be published by a select few users with past experience working with Roblox Corporation.[22][23] This arrangement was in place until the introduction of the UGC Catalog,[24][25] which allowed selected individuals within the Roblox community to create and sell customized User-Generated Content (UGC) avatar items through the UGC Program.[26][27][28] Several individuals design items as a full-time job, with the highest-earning creators making over $100,000 a year off item sales.[29]</p>
    <p>Items with a limited edition status can only be traded between or sold by users with a Roblox Premium membership.[30] These limited items have a Recent Average Price (RAP), and their value fluctuates based on its demand and rarity. Although selling these items for real-world currency violates Roblox's terms of service, this does not stop some individuals from doing so through black market sites and communities, in which limited items, some of which being stolen, are often exchanged for payment methods such as cryptocurrency or sometimes PayPal.[31] Previously, only Roblox released these limited items themselves until the introduction of "UGC Limiteds" in April 2023,[32] which allowed for those in the UGC Program to design and sell user-generated items themselves with limited quantities.[33][34] Unlike Roblox-released limited items, UGC Limiteds cannot be traded. They can, however, be resold after a 30-day holding period after being bought.[35]</p>
    <p>Robux allows players to buy various items, and are obtained by purchase with real currency, from a recurring stipend given to members with a Premium membership, and from other players by producing and selling virtual content in Roblox.[36][37] Prior to 2016, Roblox had another currency, Tix (short for "Tickets"), that was discontinued in April of that year.[38][better source needed] Robux acquired through the sale of user-generated content can be exchanged into real-world currency through the website's Developer Exchange system.[39]</p>
    <h3>Scams</h3>
    <p>There are a sizable amount of scams relating to Roblox, largely revolving around automated messages promoting scam websites, scam games designed to appear to give out free Robux, and invalid Robux codes.[40][41] In the Roblox community, there are people known as "beamers" who compromise Roblox accounts to steal and sell their items on black markets. They employ various techniques, such as creating phishing websites or ploys to acquire a victim's login token.[42] Once they gain access to the victim's account, these "beamers" steal and subsequently sell valuable limited items owned by the victims for real-world currency or cryptocurrency through marketplace sites or Discord chatrooms. The slang term "beaming" is commonly used to describe this entire process, along with the victim having been "beamed". Roblox does offer hacking victims a "rollback" for their items, although this is only offered once per account.[31]</p>
    <h3>Events</h3>
    <p>Roblox occasionally hosts real-life and virtual events. They have in the past hosted events such as BloxCon, which was a convention for ordinary players on the platform.[36] Roblox operates annual Easter egg hunts[43] and also hosts an annual event called the "Bloxy Awards", an awards ceremony that also functions as a fundraiser. The 2020 edition of the Bloxy Awards, held virtually on the platform, drew 600,000 viewers.[44][45] In 2022, "Bloxy Awards" got rebranded into the "Roblox Innovation Awards".[46] Roblox Corporation annually hosts the Roblox Developers Conference, a three-day invite-only event in San Francisco where top content creators on the site learn of upcoming changes to the platform.[47] The company has also hosted similar events in London and Amsterdam.[48][49]</p>
    <p>Roblox occasionally engages in events to promote films, such as ones held to promote Wonder Woman 1984 and Aquaman.[50][51] In 2020, Roblox hosted its first virtual concert, which was compared by Rolling Stone to that of American rapper Travis Scott's virtual concert in Fortnite,[52] during which American rapper Lil Nas X debuted his song "Holiday" to an audience of Roblox players.[52][53][54] In 2021, Swedish singer Zara Larsson performed songs at a virtual party to celebrate her the reissuing of her album Poster Girl.[55] On September 17, 2021, a virtual concert by the American band Twenty One Pilots took place.[56][57] In October 2021, Roblox partnered with Chipotle Mexican Grill to give $1 million of burritos away to the first 30,000 people every day as a part of Chipotle's Halloween Boorito promotion.[58]</p>
