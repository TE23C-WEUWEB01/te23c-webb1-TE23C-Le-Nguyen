    <h1>RIch Forever</h1>
    <h2>Song Lyrics</h2>
    <p>Swish</p>
    <p>I just lost my dawg<br>
        Nigga, my brother taught me how to chase the bag<br>
        Get right in the field I had to make a bag<br>
        The day he lost his soul, wish I could take it back<br>
        I just wanna go get one mo' bag wit my nigga<br>
        Wanna be rich forever for my dawgs<br>
        'Posed to take you on you first trip on a private jet<br>
        I vow to always ball until I fall</p>
    <p>And we been on this money shit for years<br>
        Gotta drink this mud to make the pain go away<br>
        I been dropping these codeine tears<br>
        Praying Roddy Ricch don't go insane today<br>
        We was in the high speed like fuck the static<br>
        He wanted the Rollie, I wanted the Patek<br>
        Gotta get this safe my nigga fuck around and drag it<br>
        I done seen a lot of shit behind these glasses, yeah<br>
        My life goin' through many different phases<br>
        Gotta keep the gun on me can't go too many places<br>
        Rented V12's just to mimic drag races<br>
        Nigga we was bag chasers before we had braces</p>
